0.1.0
======
xfce4-alsamixer is a port and drastic rewrite of gtk-alsamixer to GTK 3 for the Xfce desktop. This is an unofficial application.

In the process of porting a lot of bugs and issues have been fixed, making xfce4-alsamixer significantly more stable and useful to the end user.

Highlights:
- GTK 3 Port
- Improved UI (improved slider behavior, switching UI layouts on the fly and many more)
- Sliders now represent the human perception of loudness instead of decibels (thanks to code written by the alsa-utils team).
- Changing audio settings outside the app no longer causes infinite recursion.
- Capture elements are properly supported.
